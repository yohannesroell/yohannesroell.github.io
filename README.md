## üîë First Time Setup: SSH Key (Do This Once)

Before you can easily update your website from the command line, you need to set up an SSH key. This is like giving your computer a special password to talk to GitHub.

### Step 1: Check if you already have an SSH key

Open Terminal (Mac) or Command Prompt (Windows) and type:

```bash
ls -la ~/.ssh
```

If you see files like `id_rsa` and `id_rsa.pub`, you already have a key - skip to Step 3.

### Step 2: Create a new SSH key

```bash
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your.email@example.com"
```

- Replace `your.email@example.com` with your actual email
- When it asks where to save the key, just press Enter (uses default location)
- When it asks for a passphrase, you can either:
  - Press Enter twice for no passphrase (easier)
  - Or type a password you'll remember (more secure)

### Step 3: Add your SSH key to GitHub

1. **Copy your public key**:
   
   **On Mac:**
   ```bash
   cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | pbcopy
   ```
   
   **On Windows:**
   ```bash
   cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
   ```
   Then manually select and copy the output.

2. **Add key to GitHub**:
   - Go to GitHub.com and log in
   - Click your profile picture (top right)
   - Click "Settings"
   - Click "SSH and GPG keys" (left sidebar)
   - Click "New SSH key"
   - Give it a title like "My Computer"
   - Paste your key in the "Key" field
   - Click "Add SSH key"

### Step 4: Test your connection

```bash
ssh -T git@github.com
```

You should see a message like: "Hi yohannesroell! You've successfully authenticated..."

### Step 5: Clone your repository with SSH

Now you can download your website files:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:yohannesroell/yohannesroell.github.io.git
cd yohannesroell.github.io
```

**üéâ You're all set! Now you can easily update your website from the command line.**
